	// - For state sizes less than the midpoint of around 32, larger values are generally better -
	//   they allow a larger maximum frequency total (maximumTotal), and they reduce the approximation
	//   error inherent in adapting fractions to integers; both effects reduce the data encoding loss
	//   and asymptotically approach the efficiency of arithmetic coding using exact fractions.
	// - But for state sizes greater than the midpoint, because intermediate computations are limited
	//   to the long integer type's 63-bit unsigned precision, larger state sizes will decrease the
	//   maximum frequency total, which might constrain the user-supplied probability model.
	// - Therefore numStateBits=32 is recommended as the most versatile setting
	//   because it maximizes maximumTotal (which ends up being slightly over 2^30).
