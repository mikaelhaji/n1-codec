# Compression application using prediction by partial matching (PPM) with arithmetic coding
# 
# Usage: python ppm-compress.py InputFile OutputFile
# Then use the corresponding ppm-decompress.py application to recreate the original input file.
# Note that both the compressor and decompressor need to use the same PPM context modeling logic.
# The PPM algorithm can be thought of as a powerful generalization of adaptive arithmetic coding.
