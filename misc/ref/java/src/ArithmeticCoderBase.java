	 * <ul>
	 *   <li>For state sizes less than the midpoint of around 32, larger values are generally better -
	 *   they allow a larger maximum frequency total (maximumTotal), and they reduce the approximation
	 *   error inherent in adapting fractions to integers; both effects reduce the data encoding loss
	 *   and asymptotically approach the efficiency of arithmetic coding using exact fractions.</li>
	 *   <li>But for state sizes greater than the midpoint, because intermediate computations are limited
	 *   to the long integer type's 63-bit unsigned precision, larger state sizes will decrease the
	 *   maximum frequency total, which might constrain the user-supplied probability model.</li>
	 *   <li>Therefore numStateBits=32 is recommended as the most versatile setting
	 *   because it maximizes maximumTotal (which ends up being slightly over 2^30).</li>
	 *   <li>Note that numStateBits=62 is legal but useless because it implies maximumTotal=1,
	 *   which means a frequency table can only support one symbol with non-zero frequency.</li>
